The purpose of this map is to show the Net Migration of people moving in or out of states within the U.S. in 2022. The data was collected from the US Census Bureau in their 2022 population data. A red and blue diverging color palette was chosen for this map to differentiate the negative neg migration and positive net migration. Red represents a higher negative net migration while blue represents a higher positive net migration. The map contains many different interactive elements such as a hover feature that tells you the exact amount of people that moved into the state, as well as a zoom feature that will zoom the viewer into the state upon clicking. The map also includes a description, title, and legend for the viewer.
